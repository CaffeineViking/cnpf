Curl Noise Particle Flow
========================

Building
--------

1. Make sure library dependencies are in your path.

2. Place yourself in the root directory of this project.

3. Acquire the latest version of the `premake5` build system.

4. Thereafter, execute `premake5 gmake` if building on Make.

5. Finally, issue the command `make -C build` and wait.

6. When complete, either `bin` or `lib` are built.

7. Tests can be run with `bin/*-tests` program.

8. **Shortcuts**: `make run` and `make test`.

Contributing
------------

1. See if there any updates upstream: `git remote update`

2. If you are already working on a feature branch, jump to step 4.

3. Create a new branch for your feature: `git branch <feature>`

4. Change to the feature branch by: `git checkout <feature>`

5. Start/continue building the feature. Jump to 7 if done.

6. Push your changes to your remote feature branch with:
   * `git add -A` (everything) or `git add -u` (updates).
   * `git commit -m "Message describing the additions."`
   * Publish remotely: `git push origin <feature>`
   * Go back to step 1 or 5 (if working quickly).

7. Your feature is done (single/many commits).

8. Fetch the changes from upstream first:
   * Go to master: `git checkout -b master`
   * Pull changes: `git pull origin master`

8. Rebase your changes on top of `master`:
   * Back to feature: `git checkout <feature>`
   * Thereafter, issue: `git rebase master`
   * Fix any conflicts that may happen...
   * Changes now on top of the Git tree.

9. Finally, go to GitHub and issue PR.
   * Listen in on other's feedback!
   * Make changes if necessary.

10. Back to the master: `git checkout master`

11. Pat yourself on the back, then goto 1 again.

Structure
---------

* `bin`: contains the built software and accompanying testing suite.

* `build`: stores intermediate object files and generated GNU Make files.
    * `obj`: has all of the generated object files given under compilation.
    * `Makefile`: automatically generated by executing `premake5 gmake`.
    * `*.make`: program specific make config for augmenting `Makefile`.

* `docs`: any generated documentation for this project is over here.

* `include`: both external and internal project headers are here.
    * `foreign`: any foreign headers which should be included.
    * `project directories`: internal headers for the project.

* `lib`: any generated libraries from the project reside here.

* `license.md`: please look through this very carefully.

* `premake5.lua`: configuration file for the build system.

* `readme.md`: this file, contains information on the project.

* `share`: any extra data that needs to be bundled should be here.

* `src`: all source code for the project should be located below here.
    * `project directories`: source code for specific project build.
    * `foreign`: any external source files which might be needed.

* `tests`: source code for the project's testing suite, using Catch syntax.
    * `project directories`: project specific testing suite for one build.
